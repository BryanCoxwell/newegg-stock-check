# newegg-stock-check
Takes a CSV of URLs of products on Newegg and sends a text when they come in stock. 

The method for checking availability is admittedly hacky, but it works for now.

See `file.csv` for an example input CSV. 

Note that using this requires a Twilio account in order to send out text messages.
